# The 'test' Directory
All files found in this directory are intended for developers to test their code. Everything here should be compilable in the ESP-IDF framework. **Don't commit Arduino code**. 

## How to Use
To use one of these tests you will have to (temporarily) copy the c++ file to the 'src' directory. Hereafter, press the upload button in the bottom left of the Visual Studio Code editor, platform.io should automatically handle everything else.
