# The test directory
All files found in this directory are meant for testing the library. The code is usually quite useless and cluttered, it is solely meant for a developer to test their code added to the library. All of these files should be able to be compiled in the esp-idf framework, **don't commit arduino code**.
To use a test file you will have to (temperarely) copy it to the src directory.
