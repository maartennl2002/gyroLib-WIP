# The 'test' Directory
All files found in this directory are intended for developers to test their code. Everything here should be compilable with every framework (use #ifdev where needed). **Don't commit Arduino code**. 

## How to Use
These test files are intended to be used with the platform.io automated test functionality. To run these tests press the test button in the platform.io ide.
