# The test directory
All files found in this directory are meant for testing the library. The code is usually quite useless and cluttered, it is solely meant for a developer to test their code added to the library. All of these files are main files that are able to be compiled with esp-idf **don't use arduino code**.
To use a test file you will have to (temperarely) copy it to the src directory.
