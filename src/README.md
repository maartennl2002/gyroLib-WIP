# The src directory
This directory contains all the library code. The header files can be found in the include directory.

## header files
Please do not put headerfiles here, it will work, but it clutters the code.
While editing you may however find the sdkconfig.h here, this file will be autogenerated by platform.io, it will be ignored by git since all the settings can be found in platformio.ini.
