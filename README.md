# gyroLib (WIP)
'gyroLib' is a simple modular gyro library, first created for the 'ESP32 Quadcopter' project (https://github.com/maartennl2002/ESP32-Quadcopter).
At first, it will just be an Arduino library built for the ESP32 to interface with the GY-80 board.

## Roadmap To Release
- Version 0.1
Goals for version 0.1 include cleaning up the code and making it modular. Version 0.1 will also feature a clean interface.

### Version 0.2
Support for platform.io should be coming around this version. The library will fully support the Arduino and ESP-IDF frameworks.

### Version 0.3
All features required by the 'ESP32 Quadcopter' project shall be fully supported.

### Version 0.4
Version 0.4 will add support for AVR microcontrollers. Which means most Arduino board should be supported.

### Version 0.5
Documentation should be coming around version 0.5.

### Version 1.0
Version 1.0 marks the official release of the library.  Full support for the GY-80 board should be here. Documentation will be polished, and support for additional sensors or microcontrollers will be simple to add.
