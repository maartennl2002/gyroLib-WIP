# gyroLib V0.2
'gyroLib' is a simple modular gyro library, first created for the 'ESP32 Quadcopter' project (https://github.com/maartennl2002/ESP32-Quadcopter).
At first, it will just be an Arduino library built for the ESP32 to interface with the GY-80 board.

## Features
Currently 'gyroLib' works with the Arduino IDE and with platform.io. It not only supports the Arduino framework, but also the ESP-IDF framework.
The library features a clean interface that works not only for beginners, but also for experienced users. It is also built in a modular way to ensure easy implementation for new devices.

## Roadmap to Release
#### Version 0.3
Version 0.3 will add support for AVR microcontrollers. Which means most Arduino boards should be supported.
#### Version 0.4
This version will feature many examples.
#### Version 0.5
Documentation should be coming around version 0.5.
#### Version 1.0
Version 1.0 marks the official release of the library.  Full support for the GY-80 board should be here. Documentation will be polished, and support for additional sensors or microcontrollers will be simple to add.
